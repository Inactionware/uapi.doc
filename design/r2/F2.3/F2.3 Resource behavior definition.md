# Proposal  
The core of UAPI application is resource based, a resource is domain object and it should be mapped to Responsibility in behavior framework.

## Function Points

* Define Resource
* Resource map to Responsible
* Define Resource Operation
* Resource Operation map to Behavior
* Define Resource ACL (Acces Control List)
* Associate Resource ACL on Resource Operation

# Solution
The resource object likes below:

```
@Resource(...)
public class User {

    @Behavior(topic="...")
    public void signIn(IBehaviorBuilder behaviorBuilder) {
        // Create behavior of the resource
        ...
    }
}
```

The `@Resource` annotation indicate the User is a resource, if the compiler found one or more `Behavior` is defined in the class, then the generated class must be implements `ICapable` interface which means the resource has behavior to handle request.

The `ICapable` interface give behavior ability for a resource type:

```
public interface ICapable {

    void initBehavior(IResponsible responsibility);
}
```

The generated resource type like below:

```
public class Resource_User_Generated
extends User
implements ICapable {

    @Override
    public void initBehavior(
        IResponsible responsible
    ) {
        IBehavior behavior = responsible.newBehavior("signIn", ResourceRequestEvent, "User SignIn");
        super.signIn(behavior);
        behavior.publish();
        // initialize other behavior
        behavior = ...
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

When `IResourceTypeManager` is activating, it will check all registered resource type, if it found a resource type implements `ICapable` interface, it will create new `IResponsible` based on resource type name and invoke `initBehavior` method, the method will initialize all behavior for the resource type.

# Q&A

Q: For each resource type, does resource request share same event?  
A: Yes, share same event, but the the event topic is not same.

Q: How the event topic identify different resource request?  
A: The event topic uses default pattern if user does not specified event topic: resource type name + behavior name
