## Proposal

Since the model in UAPI framework is resource based, we have resource based model, resource based authenticatation, so the client query also based resource.

## Solution

The query language is JSON format based.  
Each operation must specified its applied resource, so the operation is based on resource also.

Below case is resource querying:

```
User(id: xxx, ..., first: 0, size: 10, order-by: xxx, order: ASC) {
    id,
    name,
    role {
        id,
        name
    }
}
```

```javascript
{
    operation: query,
    resource: User,
    arguments: {
        id: "xxx",
        ....
        first: 0,
        size: 10,
        order-by: "xxx",
        order: "ASC"
    },
    properties: [
        "id",
        "name",
        "role"
        {
            operation: query,
            resource: Role,
            properties: [ "id", "name" ]
        }
    ]
}
```

The arguments indicate the query arguments which must be available in the resource. and below arguments are system parameter:

*   first: The first record index, default is 0.
*   size: The count of record which is caller wants.
*   order: The order policy, ASC and DESC is the only option, ASC is default.
*   order-by: The order field, default is based on underlaryer persistence default policy.

The properties indeicate which properties of the resource will be returned to caller, they also need available in the resource.

The return data is:

```
{
    code: 0,
    message: "xxx",
    data: [{
        id: "xxx",
        name: "xxx",
        role:
    ]
}
```

Below is example for modify resource:

```
{
    operation: modify,
    resource: User,
    arguments: {
        id: "xxx",
        name: "xxx",
        ...
    },
    properties: [
        "id",
        "name",
        {
            operation: query,
            resource: Role,
            properties: ["id", "name"]
        }
    ]
}
```

The request modify user
