## Proposal

Based on Java modularization we can wrap java run-time library into the application that it is not necessary to install whole Java run-time in the client side, and we also only wrap necessary module into the application.

## Solution

*   Generate module description by service annotation
    
*   New annotation to define all other statement which is supported in module-info file
    
*   Using Java 9 tool to warp run-time library into the application
    
*   The codegen project needs support load external annotation handler by module provides notion.
    
*   All apt project needs register its annotation handler by module provides notion.
    
*   The codegen project needs support generate module-info file at compile time, and to support customized configuration in generated module-info, the project will try load a module description class at compiling time, the module description class is a generic java class which must annotated with `@Module` annotation and the class should implements `IModule` interface, like below:
    
    ```java
    public interface IModule {
      public default String[] name() { return null };
      public String[] exports();
      public String[] requires();
      public String[] uses();
      public Provide[] provides();
    }
    ```
    
*   A module handler is responsible to handle module description class at compile-time, the handle must be instanced and invoked before all other annotation handler since other handler may contribute configuration to this module.
    

## Q&A
TODO

## Note

*   The default module name is project name if the name is not specified.
*   The module handler does not check current project has a module-info file, the code generation will failed if current project has a module-info and the module handler needs generate another module-info file.
