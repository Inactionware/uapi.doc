## Proposal

The UAPI based application is resource based, currently we have below frameworks:

*   Resource definition framework
*   Protocol framework
*   Network framework
*   Authentication framework  
    resource definition framework, network framework and authentication framework is almost ready, we need integrate them all, below points need to identify:
*   How network request map to url
    

## Solution

General workflow:

*   Network framework listen network request, fire `NetworkRequest` event for incoming request.
*   Protocol framework monitor all `NetworkRequest`, find out specific protocol to decode the event, and convert it to `ResourceRequest` object.
*   (Optional) Authentication framework get the `ResourceRequest` will do authentication operation.
*   The Resource definition framework fetch resource identify and its operation from the `ResourceRequest` object, find out related registered resource behavior to execute.
*   The resource behavior will output `ResourceResponse`.
*   Protocol framework use specific protocol to encode `ResourceResponse` and put data in the `NetworkResponse` event, and fire the event.
*   Network framework get the `NetworkResponse` event, send the response to the peer.

The workflow change to behavior likes below:

```java
server.newBehavior("Handle API request", HttpEvent.class, "/api")
    .then(DecodeRestfulRequest.class)
    .then(VerifyPermission.class)
    .then(HandleResourceRequest.class)
    .then(EncodeRestfulRequest.class)
    .onSuccess((success, ctx) -> new HttpResponseEvent(...))
    .onFailure((failure, ctx) -> ...)
    .build()
```
